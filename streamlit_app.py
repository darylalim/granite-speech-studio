    has installed, and that broke twice in one week: Homebrew moved `ffmpeg`
    to 9.0 while torchcodec 0.15 only ships loaders for 4–8, and torchcodec
    0.16 added the 9 loader but dropped the /opt/homebrew rpath from its
    dylibs, so on Apple Silicon it finds nothing at all. Neither is fixable
    from inside the process (dyld reads its search paths at launch), so the
    app now depends on no system FFmpeg. torchaudio stays for its pure-torch
    resampler, which never touches torchcodec.

    Frames are converted to planar float32 at their own layout and
    rate before concatenation: a pure sample-format conversion, so swresample
    buffers nothing and every codec's output — packed or planar, s16 or
    fltp — lands in the same (channels, samples) matrix scaled to [-1, 1].
