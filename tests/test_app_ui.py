"""End-to-end UI tests driving the real main() widget tree via AppTest.

These complement test_streamlit_app.py (which mocks `st` entirely and never
exercises the UI wiring). AppTest re-executes streamlit_app.py in a fresh
namespace on every .run(), so mocks must patch the SHARED upstream imports
(mlx_audio, av) rather than streamlit_app.* — patching streamlit_app
attributes does not cross AppTest's script-runner boundary, and clicking Run
without an upstream patch would fetch the real ~0.9 GB speech model and the
MLX VAD checkpoint from the Hub.

The Run tests are hermetic: the speech model is stubbed at its loader, and the
MLX VAD loader is made to fail so load_vad_model takes its documented fallback
onto the PyTorch build that ships inside the silero-vad wheel — real VAD spans
on the fixture, nothing downloaded.

Layout assertions go through `at.sidebar`, `at.main` and the two `at.columns`
rather than the whole-tree accessors: AppTest walks main before the sidebar
and the input column before the transcript column, so `at.caption[0]` would
keep resolving to the filename only for as long as nothing rendered a caption
above it. Saying where an element lives makes the test document the layout
instead of depending on iteration order.
